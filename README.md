# ESG-vs-Non-ESG-ETFs-Analysis-
This project employs Python, Power BI, Excel, and MySQL for a comprehensive analysis comparing ESG ETFs to traditional ETFs in US, global, emerging, and European markets.

Highlighted Aspects
- Data Sources: Our primary datasets were sourced from Yahoo Finance and etf.com, forming the bedrock of our analysis.
- Data Organization: Initial data aggregation and structuring were meticulously executed using MS Excel, ensuring a clean and coherent dataset.
- Analytical Tools: Our comprehensive analysis was empowered by Python, leveraging robust libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn, along with SQL and Power BI.
- Examined Metrics: Our project delves deeply into key performance indicators including cumulative return, excess return, standard deviation (as a representation of risk), as well as the Sharpe Ratio and Information Ratio, both indicative of risk-adjusted returns.

Key Insights
- Overall Performance: ESG ETFs and Non-ESG ETFs exhibit similar long-term performance trends, yet distinct variations emerge in specific markets and across economic cycles.
